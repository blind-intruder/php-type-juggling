# PHP type juggling

In PHP you can compare two variables using these two methods.
 * Loose comparison ('==' or '!=')
 * Strict comparison ('===' or !==)

# Type juggling
PHP has a feature called “type juggling”, or “type coercion”. This means that during the comparison of variables of different types, PHP will first convert them to a common, comparable type.
